<h1>Johan's Movie List</h1>

<h2>My Favourite Movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Entouchables</h3>
<p>Seen it about 8 times.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter series</h3>
<p>Especially the earlier ones because of sentimental value.</p>

<h3>Afterlife</h3>
<p>Not a movie but my all time favourite series. 
It has everything from humour to beauty to sadness. 
The music is great too.</p>
